# AWS SAM Jupyter 

AWS SAM project that allows invoking Jupyter notebooks dynamically using the AWS Lambda as the execution environment.




### Test your application locally ###

If running the API for the first time, or **when requirements.txt** file was updated, the following script
should be executed first:

    ./scripts/build.sh
    
It will install and build all dependencies against the Amazon Linux and will place them in the `build/` 
directory.


Use [SAM Local](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sam-local) to run your Lambda function locally:

    sam local start-api
    
The API will be running at[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Deploy ###

Everything can be deployed with a single command

    ./scripts/deploy.sh <Bucket-Name> <Stack-Name> <Region>
